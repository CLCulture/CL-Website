      <li>No one here gets special treatment from 100chilly or the staff. Everyone is assigned an administrator/developer/moderator role by having previous and prior experience and intense review by 100chilly with input from other staff. We are to treat everyone the same as well as follow the rules ourselves. If this is not being followed and is brought to 100chilly’s direct attention, He will instantly begin an internal review and take immediate action upon the review results.
</li>
      <li>Have fun and relax with others!</li>
    </ol>

      <li>We reserve the right to remove content that we think that hurts or is not tasteful to the server or any topic.

    </ol>

    <h3 class="white-text">Other things to consider:</h3>
    <ol class="white-text">
      <li>There is no serious discussion channel here. All serious discussions can be done in a Group/Individual DMs as long as they follow the Discord ToS and Guidelines. It's not that we don’t care but we want to avoid any drama that others may start and it turning into a big issue.</li>
      <li>Promoting or talking about Self-Harm/Suicide or hurting others is not only not allowed here but is against Discord’s Terms of Service and guidelines and we will take action if we feel the threat is credible and need to have proper authorities involved. This also falls under Rule #4 in the basic rules section.</li>
      <li>#ivgas-suggestions is a privilege to have. Posting in there must not regard staff members removal or anything. If you have issues with a staff member on actions they’ve done on this server, ask to DM 100chilly.</li>
      <li>Bots will be added over time so please don't pester staff about them. Leave a suggestion on bots you want added in #I.V.G.A.S-suggestions. In addition to posting suggestions on bots to be added, We are going to focus on bots that are open-sourced and the code is freely available to look at and review on GitHub. This prevents any malicious bots from being added with the exception of DynoBot.</li>
      <li>Common sense: If you think there's a chance you will get in trouble for posting something, don't post it because usually you will get in trouble. Staff can review and give you their input, but asking them about everything, every minute is not acceptable and can be considered trolling so don’t be that one guy who asks staff if “can I post this?” on everything.</li>
    </ol>
